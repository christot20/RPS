# RPS
Students were tasked in intially creating a command line Rock Paper scissors program where the player would 
play against a computer in a first to 5 match. Students will later on learn and add a graphical interface
to the game and allow it to be played on a webpage.

1. Use of Javascript and conditional statements.
2. Using arrays to store random values for computer choices.
3. Using loops to allow for the game to continue on until a winner is decided.
4. Use of internal functions for case insensitivity.
5. Use of functions with parameters to structure code into blocks.
6. Use of Git for version control and branch merging(code needed to be saved regularly so it could be changed for the webpage portion).
7. DOM manipulation and incroporation of HTML, CSS,and JS all in one project

What I learned:
1. How to use if statements and conditionals in Javascript.
2. How to use arrays to store values in Javascript.
3. How to loop in Javascript and use functions.
4. How to use version control to save work that will need to be changed later.
5. JS DOM Manipulation and use of HTML, CSS, and JS in one project together

What's Next:
1. Learning SASS and PostCSS
2. More advanced use of DOM manipulation
3. Learning of objects in JS

Project led by The Odin Project.
